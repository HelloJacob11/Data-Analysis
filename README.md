## [1. Exploring Sentiment Analysis on IMDb Reviews with Machine Learning Model](https://github.com/HelloJacob11/Data-Analysis/blob/main/Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb)
- Dataset: [IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews)
###  Used text(50K IMDb reviews) to predict if a certain review is positive or negative using the Machine Learning Model (ML). I created a ML that conducts preprocessing of Tfidf Vectorizer and modeling of Logistic Regression that uses numerical features from TF-IDF (Pipeline module was used to combine these steps). 80% of the IMDb reviews were used for training ML while the 20% of the reviews were used for testing purposes. At the end, this model had over 90% accuracy.

## [2. Predicting Loan Default Risk Using Decision Tree Classification on Synthetic Financial Data](https://github.com/HelloJacob11/Data-Analysis/blob/main/Loan.ipynb)
- Dataset: [Loan Default Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmldas/loan-default-prediction)
### This project utilizes a synthetic financial dataset derived from real-world patterns to build a binary classification model predicting loan default risk. Using a decision tree algorithm, the model analyzes features such as employment status, bank balance, and annual salary to determine the likelihood of default, offering insights into key financial risk factors.
