## [1. Exploring Sentiment Analysis on IMDb Reviews with Machine Learning Model](https://github.com/HelloJacob11/Data-Analysis/blob/main/Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb)
###  Used text(50K IMDb reviews) to predict if a certain review is positive or negative using the Machine Learning Model (ML). I created a ML that conducts preprocessing of Tfidf Vectorizer and Logistic Regression model using numerical features from TF-IDF (Pipeline module was used to combine these steps). 80% of the IMDb reviews were used for training ML while the 20% of the reviews were used for testing purposes. At the end, this model had over 90% accuracy.
